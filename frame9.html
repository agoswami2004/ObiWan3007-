<h1>LUXURY CAR MANUFACTURER</h1>
<h2>BOLDER EMTIONS TAKE LONGER</h2>
<p>The history of Alfa Romeo, an Italian car manufacturer known for producing
 sports cars,
began on June 24, 1910 with the founding of ALFA (an acronym for "Anonima 
Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili") 
in Milan.In 1918 the company changed its name to "Alfa Romeo" following 
the acquisition of control of the 
company by Nicola Romeo.<br/>
In 1933 ownership of Alfa Romeo passed, through IRI, to the Italian 
state because of the heavy 
debt the company had incurred with banks since the previous decade
 in the production departments. From this decade on, Alfa Romeo 
experienced a phase of growing success that reached its peak in the 1960s. 
In the 1970s, however, there was
 a turnaround that caused a deep crisis.
The failing finances then led the Italian state, in 1986, to sell the 
automaker to the Fiat group.
The revival of Alfa Romeo took place in the second part of the 1990s. 
In 2014, it became part of the brands 
controlled by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and from 2021 by Stellantis.
